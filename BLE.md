Bluetooth is a wireless technology for communication which has simple characteristics but can give higher level of security. It is widely used in many applications belongs to vast range of fields due to low power consumption and low cost. Any two Bluetooth enabled devises which are close to each other can be connected by pairing and that creates full duplex communication for data and voice. This paring and data sharing can be done up through eight devices. One device which is called as the master device acts as a hub and other devices within the network communicate though the master device. Full duplex competences of Bluetooth help for so many smart applications by giving mobility. Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) is initially Designed by Nokia as a part of version 4.0 specially for low cost and power consumption.
